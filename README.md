## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to examine the bikeshare data in the 5 boroughs of New York in order to determine the feasability of bikeshare in other cities such as Des Moines.

From this chart one can surmize that subscribers utilize the app most during the weak. The disparity between usage and gender appears more prevelently in the subscribers with the trips by male subscribers being nearly three times that of the female subscribers. Regular customers are lesser in number than subscribers and there is a smaller disparity between trips performed by males than by females. 
Overall for regular customers, the largest number of trips are performed on the weekends. Within the regular customers, The unknown gender group performs the most trips. From this, one could surmize the people who are non-subscribers use the app for one time uses or for just over the weekend.

The utilization is relatively even throughout the bikes. Overall need for bike repairs is low for a majority of the bikes.


## Summary 
Through this analysis one can conclude a few things:
* The best target demographic to start with is younger males with medium to short work commutes
   * Expanding advertisment to other gender groups as the company grows is recomended
* The app must provide both a subscription option as well as easy one time ride options
   * This will make sure it reaches both the largest target demographic and tourists as well.
* The increasing usage by younger persons suggest bikeshare will become a large commuting option moving forward.
* Placing more bikes in places with heavy commute traffic and/or lots of tourist locations would increase usage.
* Any maintanance on bikes or the app should take place during non active hours. 
* Because of even utilization and shorter overall trips, repairs remain realtively low in neccesity for prolonged amounts of time.

Recomendations: 
* A chart comparing usertype, subscriber or regular customer, and birthyear to see if the younger generations, which are the biggest users, are utilizing the subscritption service.
* A chart that compares gender and birthyear to see if the trend in the gender disparity is continual throuhg all generations and how it might change over time.
